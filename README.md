# Dog Adoption and Care

Application where users can view dogs up for adoption/fostering, adopt/foster a dog, post about a dog available for adoption/fostering or write a post (maybe asking for help or really just anything related to dogs). Users can also choose to donate (monetarily/pet products) or volunteer for the adoption home. The application will post details about events like adoption camps. Users can also view the help section regarding locations of pet food stores, vet clinics and other doggo related information.
